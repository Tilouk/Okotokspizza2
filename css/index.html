                Pizza Hut is an American restaurant chain and international franchise which was founded
                in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas by Dan and Frank Carney. The company is known for its Italian

                This is my go-to pizza dough recipe. It was published on my blog 6 years ago and after
                making it for the millionth time, I decided itâ€™s time for an update with a video tutorial
                and clearer recipe instructions. Plus, many of you said you want to conquer your fear of
                yeast this year! Consider this your starting guide and refer back to it often.
